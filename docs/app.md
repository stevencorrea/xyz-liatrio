# Application Documentation

This is a simple app that satisfies the following requirement:
> REST endpoint that returns a JSON payload of current timestamp and a message

This will be a Node app using the express framework to create an endpoint. We will serve the JSON payload upon a GET to the endpoint.

We can construct the message _in_ the response in order for the message to display the current time. 

Because Date.now()'s value is returned in ms, we will also leverage Math.floor() and divide the result by 1000.


### Steps to recreate
1. Node and npm are already installed in Codespaces. If you're in a different environment, [install node for your platform](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Grab Hello World server code from the Getting Started documentation, save as server.js
1. Run `npm init` to create a `package.json`, specify `server.js` as the _entry point_ in the interactive script
1. Install express `npm install express`
1. Change `res.send('Hello World!')` on Line 6 to `res.json()`
1. Define our message body by adding the following into `res.json()`
```javascript
  {"message": "Automate all the things!",
  "timestamp": Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)}
}
```
1. Save our changes and test using `npm start`
1. Curl the endpoint and get the response:
```shell
@stevencorrea ‚ûú /workspaces/xyz-liatrio (main) $ curl localhost:3001
{"message":"Automate all the things!","timestamp":1676930786}
```

1. Let's use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) to view the response in the format listed in the problem statement. We can also use curl's silent flag `-s` to hide the verbose output that's passed from curl by default:
```shell
@stevencorrea ‚ûú /workspaces/xyz-liatrio (main) $ curl localhost:3001 -s | jq .
{
  "message": "Automate all the things!",
  "timestamp": 1676930823
}
```
Looks good to me üëçüèº
